			<p>
				Hi! I’m Jack Sweeney — a graduate student at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business, 
				where I’m pursuing my Master of Science in Information Systems. I’m passionate about 
				bridging the gap between business and technology through data-driven strategy, 
				intelligent automation, and well-designed digital systems that empower organizations to operate smarter.
			</p>

			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>
				My professional journey has blended analytics, development, and process optimization. 
				As anMIS Analytics Intern at IDI Composites, I’ve developed interactive Power BI dashboards, 
				translating complex data into actionable insights that guide strategic decision-making. 
				During my time as a Business Analyst Intern at Assiduous in Dublin strong, 
				I helped automate reporting pipelines using Python and Power BI, 
				while contributing to client pitch decks and financial models that strengthened organizational strategy.
			</p>

			<p>
				My academic foundation is built on a B.S. in Business (Information Systems) from the Kelley School of Business, 
				where I focused on business analytics, data design, and digital transformation. 
				These experiences shaped how I think about systems not just as tools — but as drivers of efficiency, insight, and innovation.
			</p>

			<h3>Interests & Goals</h3>
			<p>
				I’m deeply interested in enterprise platforms (like SAP and Oracle EBS), 
				data visualization, and the growing intersection between AI and business decision-making. 
				My long-term goal is to work as a Business Analyst or Product Manager, 
				where I can design, implement, and manage digital solutions that improve operational intelligence 
				and connect strategy to execution.
